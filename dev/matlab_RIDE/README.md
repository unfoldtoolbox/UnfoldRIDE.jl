# Matlab Ride Project

This project contains the orginal matlab RIDE implementation with some scripts that were used during the development of UnfoldRIDE. There are scripts to:
- import and run simulated data and benchmark
- run matlab sample data and benchmark
- export algorithm results for plotting in julia
- export sample data for use in UnfoldRIDE

Import and export paths are set to use the /dev/data directory of UnfoldRIDE.

The Matlab RIDE Project is available here:

EEGLAB is also included, as matlab RIDE uses it to import data and for topoplots.
